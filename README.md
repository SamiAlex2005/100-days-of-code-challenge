# 100-days-of-code-challenge
This is my 100 days of code challenge in which I will upload every projects I made based on the concepts I will learn throughout my 100 days of code journey. My goals is to achieve intermediate - advanced level in vanilla Python or with very few libraries(eg, requests, beautifulsoup), learning html, css and Vanilla JavaScript, learnning SQL and how to connect and manage it with Python, We will see how far I will go!

## Day One
In Day One I learned some basic fundamentals of Python. Like variables, data types, operators, conditional statements and control flows(while loops, for loops, if, elif and else), collections(Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries), and functions.
