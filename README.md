# 100-days-of-code-challenge
This is my 100 days of code challenge in which I will upload every projects I made based on the concepts I will learn throughout my 100 days of code journey. My goals is to achieve intermediate - advanced level in vanilla Python or with very few libraries(eg, requests, beautifulsoup), learning html, css and Vanilla JavaScript, learnning SQL and how to connect and manage it with Python, We will see how far I will go!

## Day One
In Day One I learned some basic fundamentals of Python. Like variables, data types, operators, conditional statements and control flows(while loops, for loops, if, elif and else), collections(Lists, Tuples, Sets), and a bit of functions.

## Day Two
I didn't learned new topic on day two but I tried to build tic tac toe game even if it's not clean coded due to my limited knowlefge on usage of functions.
### Projects
- [Tic-Tac-Toe](https://github.com/SamiAlex2005/100-days-of-code-challenge/blob/main/Day%20Two/tic-tac-toe.py)
## Day Three
Learned nothing due to no power in our house!
## Day Four
Learned nothing becuase I am to lazy!
## Day Five
### Projects
- [Enhanced version of my previous tic tac toe game](https://github.com/SamiAlex2005/100-days-of-code-challenge/blob/main/enhanced-tic-tac-toe.py)
